## Testing

1. After setting up above solution, you should have an automated pipeline to trigger based on the schedule you defined in Amazon EventBridge scheduled ruleâ€™s cron expression. You may view Amazon CloudWatch logs and troubleshoot issues if any in the lambda function.

2. You could also view the query execution status in Amazon Redshift Console, which would also allow you to view detailed execution plan for the queries you executed.
